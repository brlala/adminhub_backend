This project is developed using FastAPI for the added benefits of:
1. Model verification
2. Faster response as compared to Django and Flask, even more lightweight
3. cleaner API design
4. OpenAPI self documentation

Technical debt
1. replace the triggered_count and status in get_questions with the correct API `routers\questions.py`
